    "construct a table of rows and columns with the individual cell frequencies\n",

    "*Number of males who smoke cigars:* 51% of adults are males; so there are 51,000 males. If 9.5% of them smoke, that makes 0.095 x 51,000 = 4845. Then, males who do not smoke are 51,000 - 4845 = 46,155. See the table where these values go.\n",

    "*Number of females who smoke cigars:* 49% of the adults are females, that makes 49,000. 1.7% of them are smokers, so 0.017 x 49,000 = 833. The number of females who do not smoke is 49,000 - 833 = 48,167. Again look at the table below. "
