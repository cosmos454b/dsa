    "The boss decides to use probability to decide, and walks straight to the workload schedule. (S)he reasons that, since the three employees work at the same speed, the probability that a randomly selected file would have been filed by each one would be proportional to his workload. The boss notifies Moe that he has until the end of the day to empty his desk. But Moe argues in his defense that the boss has ignored additional information. Moe’s likelihood of having misfiled a document is smaller than Larry’s and Curly’s, since he is a diligent worker who pays close attention to his work. Moe admits that he works longer than the others, but he doesn’t make as many mistakes as they do. Thus, Moe recommends that – before making a decision – the boss should update the probability (initially based on workload alone) to incorporate the likelihood of having observed a misfiled document.\n",

If the boss were to make a decision based only on the worker’s overall accuracy, then Curly should get the axe. But Curly hears this and interjects that he only works a short period during the day, and consequently makes mistakes only very rarely; there is only the tiniest chance that he misfiled this particular document.\n",
