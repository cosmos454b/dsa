    "## Support Vector Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering algorithms can be parametric or non-parametric. Clustering can be done in many ways like a parametric model, as in the k-means algorithm, or by grouping points according to some distance or similarity measure as in hierarchical clustering algorithm or density estimation. These algorithms look limited in power as they have certain limitations. \n",
    "\n",
    "SVC is a nonparametric clustering algorithm that does not make any assumption on the number or shape of the clusters in the data. It works best for low-dimensional data. if the data is high-dimensional, a preprocessing step, e.g. principal component analysis, is usually required. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Support Vector Clustering (SVC) algorithm data points are mapped from data space to a high dimensional feature space using a Gaussian(normal distribution) kernel. In feature space we look for the smallest sphere that encloses the image of the data using the Support Vector Domain Description algorithm. This sphere is mapped back to data space, where it forms a set of contours which enclose the data points. These contours are interpreted as cluster boundaries. Points enclosed by each separate contour are associated with the same cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "SVC uses Support Vector Domain Description (SVDD) to delineate the region in data space where the input examples are concentrated. It looks for the smallest enclosing sphere in the feature space defined by the kernel function. While in feature space the data is described by a sphere, when mapped back to data-space the sphere is transformed into a set of non-linear contours that enclose the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The boundaries generated by SVDD become increasingly non-linear as the parameter $\\gamma$ which governs the width of the Gaussian, is increased as shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/gamma.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As the value of Î³ is increased the SVDD boundary fits the data more tightly, and at several values of $\\gamma$ the enclosing boundary splits, forming an increasing number of components (clusters). The so-called support vectors are the data points that are on the boundary.\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/ignore_outliers.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "SVC can deal with outliers by employing a soft margin constant that allows the sphere in feature space not to enclose all points. For large values of this parameter, we can also deal with overlapping clusters. "
