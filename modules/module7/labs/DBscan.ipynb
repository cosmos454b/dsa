    "The key idea is that for each point of a cluster, the neighborhood of a given radius has to contain at least a minimum number of points. There are two importantparameters, \"eps\" defines the radius of neighborhood of each point and \"minpts\" is the number of neighbors within any \"eps\" radius. The algorithm works as below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* First scan: For each point, compute the distance with all other points. Increment a neighbor count if the distance is smaller than \"eps\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* Second scan: For each point, mark it as a core point if its neighbor count is greater than \"minpts\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Third scan: For each core point, if it is not already assigned a cluster, create a new cluster and assign that to this core point as well as all of its neighbors within \"eps\" radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other cluster, density based cluster can have some outliers (data points that doesn't belong to any clusters). On the other hand, it can detect clusters of arbitrary shapes. Clusters doesn't have to be circular at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows the different types of points (core, border and outlier points) using MinPts = 6. Here x is a core point because neighboursϵ(x)=6neighboursϵ(x)=6, y is a border point because neighboursϵ(y)<MinPtsneighboursϵ(y)<MinPts, but it belongs to the ϵϵ-neighborhood of the core point x. Finally, z is a noise point.\n",

The choice of **ϵ** could be a disadvantage for DBSCAN as it is sensitive to **ϵ** when clusters have different densities. If **ϵ** is too small, sparser clusters will be defined as noise. If **ϵ** is too large, denser clusters may be merged together. So if there are clusters with different local densities, then a single **ϵ** value will not give good results."
