    "Multivariate regression deals with the case where there are more than one response variables that you want to regress over one or more predictors. On the other hand, multiple regression deals with the case where there is one dependent variable but more than one independent variable.\n",

    "For example, consider a doctor has collected data on cholesterol, blood pressure, and weight of different patients.  He also collected data on the eating habits of the subjects like the amount of vegetables included in the diet, how many ounces of red meat, dairy products, chocolate consumed per week etc. He wants to investigate the relationship between the three measures of health and four measures of eating habits. Multivariate Regression is the solution to solve this kind of problems.\n",

    "The dataset used in this notebook is about energy analysis using 12 different simulated building shapes. The buildings differ with respect to the glazing area, the glazing area distribution, and the orientation, amongst other parameters. Dataset has 768 samples and 8 features. There are two response variables Heating load and Cooling load which are predicted using eight independent variables. "
